# TASK-INTERN-CAREER
Repository contains two tasks accomplished during my internship at Intern Career

The first project contains valuable information about the top YouTube streamers, including their ranking, categories, subscribers, country, visits, likes, comments, and more.
My task is to perform a comprehensive analysis of the dataset to extract insights about the top YouTube content creators.

The second project sourced from a Terrorism Database contains information about terrorist attacks worldwide. It includes details such as the date, location, attack type,
weapons used, number of casualties, and responsible groups. My task is to create a Power BI dashboard that provides a comprehensive overview of global terrorism trends and patterns.
